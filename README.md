# DATA472 Individual Project Submission - Hua Wang

As a volunteer of Central Collect Team, I have contribute in this course by providing both Individual Project and Central Collect Team working following:

## Individual Project

1. **Flask WEB API Example**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Data472-Individual-Project-Pipeline/flask-web-api-example)
    - **Description**: This project is a simple example of a Flask web API that runs as a Operation System level service and returns a HTTP JSON response. The initial thought was to inspire other classmates due to some of them struggling with how to runs up a Web API and how to runs a service on AWS EC2 instance.

2. **DATA472-Individual-Project-Example**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Data472-Individual-Project-Pipeline/DATA472-Individual-Project-Example)
    - **Description**: This project is a Hua Wang individual project example for DATA472 course. The initial thought was to implement the first individual project for Central Collection Team to get start with collecting work. I have collected the Canterbury area Air Quality Index data from the ECAN website, and generated a GraphiQl API to provide the data to Central Collection Team used to visualise.
  
3. **Data472-individual-project-visualisation-example**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aemooooon/Data472-individual-project-visualisation-example/tree/main)
    - **Description**: This project serves as a data visualization for Central Collection Team pre-research. The initial thought was to plot the specific insights of the data from the Canterbury area Air Quality Index data from the ECAN website.
